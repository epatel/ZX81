ZX81
====

Small Arduino project to use an old Sinclair ZX81 keyboard as a USB keyboard.

* Based on https://github.com/smittytone/ZX81Alt
* Media key adaption from http://stefanjones.ca/blog/arduino-leonardo-remote-multimedia-keys

Modified to support Swedish keyboard layout (Mac).

Added support for Media keys. Yay! My own custom media keyboard. Easy play/pause, next track and volume control!

In Keyboard mode:

<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> Goto player mode.

In Player mode:

<kbd>0</kbd> Goto keyboard mode.

<kbd>q</kbd> Volume up.

<kbd>a</kbd> Volume down.

<kbd>Space</kbd> Next track.

<kbd>SHIFT</kbd> Previous track.

Other keys start/stop player.
