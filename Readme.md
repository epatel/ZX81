ZX81
====

Small Arduino project to use an old Sinclair ZX81 keyboard as a USB keyboard.

Based on https://github.com/smittytone/ZX81Alt

Modified to support Swedish keyboard layout (Mac).

Added support for Media keys. Yay! My own custom media keyboard. Easy play/pause, next track and volume control!
