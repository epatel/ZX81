ZX81
====

Small Arduino project to use an old Sinclair ZX81 keyboard as a USB keyboard.

Based on https://github.com/smittytone/ZX81Alt
Media key adaption from http://stefanjones.ca/blog/arduino-leonardo-remote-multimedia-keys

Modified to support Swedish keyboard layout (Mac).

Added support for Media keys. Yay! My own custom media keyboard. Easy play/pause, next track and volume control!
